### Selection of Regression Models under Linear Restrictions for Fixed and Random Designs

This project studies the use of information criteria, either squared-error based (e.g Cp, RCp, FPE and Sp) or Kullback-Leibler (KL) based (e.g. AICc), on variable selection and general restriction problems, under either fixed-X or random-X design. A novel KL-based criterion for random-X, RAICc is proposed and justified. KL-based criteria (AICc and RAICc) provide better predictive performance compared to the squared-error based criteria and cross-validation. For more details, see our paper [Tian, S., Hurvich, C. and Simonoff, J. (2020): "Selection of Regression Models under Linear Restrictions for Fixed and Random Designs"](https://github.com/sentian/RAICc/blob/master/paper/ms.pdf).

This repository provides the code to reproduce the simulation results and the figures in the paper. The complete set of simulation results is presented at the [supplemental material](https://github.com/sentian/RAICc/blob/master/paper/simuresults-compressed.pdf)).
